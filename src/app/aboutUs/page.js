                <p>
                    The Protective Services Department (PSD) at UNIZULU was set up to assist the University in executing 
                    its mission of ensuring a safe and secure environment that is conducive to teaching and learning.
                    With more than 80 staff members at the KwaDlangezwa and Richards Bay Campuses, the Department has made 
                    great strides in crime prevention on campus through increased visibility of uniformed officers, 
                    satellite stations, community engagement as well as institutional campaigns.
